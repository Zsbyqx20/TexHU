## Final Lookings
(Remained nothing)

## Current Progress
- [x] Create github repo.
- [ ] Finish Chinese `readme.md`.
- [ ] Extract the basic structure of the `.sty` or `.cls`.
- [ ] Set several options for the main structure.
### Problems Remained
- Any method to integrate custom fonts in the `.sty` or `.cls` (will we just put the fonts in the folder, or some "**prettier**" ways)?

## Folders Explained
- **assets**: containing some essential attachments like `png`, `eps`, etc.
- **drafts**: unstructured code.
- **test**: put MRE (minimal, reproducible example) `.tex` files.
